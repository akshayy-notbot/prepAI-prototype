    I would start by understanding the requirements and constraints. For 1 million concurrent users, 
    I'd need to consider scalability, reliability, and performance. I'd use a distributed architecture 
    with load balancers, multiple application servers, and a distributed database. I'd also implement 
    caching strategies and consider using CDNs for static content. The system would need horizontal 
    scaling capabilities and proper monitoring.
